Implementing a battling of malducks to stream malware captured from the endpoint to Elastic cloud

## Our Inspiration

> Malware can be 'fowl'
> But we can 'quack' its secrets
> With our friend malduck

## Our Goal

Build a solution that can execute in a container that can stream events from an
Elasticsearch cluster that contains captured bytes from malware detected on the
endpoint, process it using malduck with an ECS-friendly output, then store it
in Elasticsearch (optionally, a different cluster)

## Building

```
docker build -t elastic-malware-config-extractor:latest .```
